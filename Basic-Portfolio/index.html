            I used to live in a city next to Manila, one of the most densely populated cities in the world.
            Quezon City has more trees, open spaces, shopping centers, bigger houses and wider roads. 
            Life was easier and traffic was a little tolerable back in the days. Orlando is what
            Quezon City like back in the days. I graduated high school in Quezon City and I have a lot of
            my friends still living in that city. Our family used to go to the market to buy seafood and 
            ate it during the weekends. My favorite among the seafood that we were buying was the Green Caviar 
            mixed with Calamondin, Chopped Tomatoes and Chopped Onions. I love experimenting with food while 
            my sister strictly follows a recipe.
